# Installing the iPod Board
This is prehaps the most brutal solder job I've ever witnessed. This is the process for the iPod Nano 3G. You will have to prod other kinds of iPods to find the appropriate pins.

## Soldering
TODO get Wesley's opinion on this

I can't stress how challening of a solder this is. You're basically soldering to the _side_ of a chip. It's absolutely brutal. But you only need to do it thrice:

TODO: insert image of the pinout around the DAC chip.

The rest of the soldering is done rather easily.

TODO: List of connections for battery, ground, data, and meta signals.

## Testing
TODO: At this point it might just be easier to build and install the iPod software before proceeding further.
