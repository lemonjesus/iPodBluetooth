This code is for testing the Rockbox fat code on a dummy drive image file.

Dummy image
-----------
Here's how to create a 1 gig dummy drive image in linux:

# dd if=/dev/hda of=disk.img bs=1M count=1024

You can then format disk.img as a FAT32 partition:

# mkdosfs -F 32 disk.img

To mount the image, your linux kernel must include the loopback device:

# mount -o loop disk.img /mnt/image

Now copy some test data to the disk, umount it and start testing.

The test script mounts the disk image in order to initialize it will a number
of dummy files. Since users are no longer allowed to mount loopback devices,
you can either run the test script as root (not recommended) or add a line to
your fstab file:

/path/to/disk.img /mnt/dummy vfat loop,users,noauto 0 0


Test code
---------
The files in this dir build the 'fat' program. It will read 'disk.img' and
treat is as a real disk, thanks to the ata-sim.c module.

Modify the main.c source code to make it perform the tests you want.
